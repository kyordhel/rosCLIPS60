CLIPS is a public domain software tool for building expert systems.

Public-domain software is software that has been placed in the public
domain, in other words, software for which there is absolutely no
ownership such as copyright, trademark, or patent. Software in the
public domain can be modified, distributed, or sold even without any
attribution by anyone; this is unlike the common case of software under
exclusive copyright, where licenses grant limited usage rights.
